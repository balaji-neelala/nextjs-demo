  "About_para1": "NDAP will be a reliable platform for up-to-date data. Standard Operating Procedures(SOPs) will be developed to keep data updated. There will be regular tracking of compliance to these SOPs. Further, APIs, web-crawling and other methods will be used to keep the data fully up-to-date.",
  "About_para2": "Successful of NDAP relies on effective collaboration. NDAP goes beyond just developing a platform and will require extensive consultation. Inputs will be needed from data procedures in the government to identify data sources and develop data processing techniques for the datasets to be coherent. Regular feedback from users -- policymakers, bureaucrats, researchers, innovators, data scientists, journalists and citizens -- will also assist in ensuring the platform stays relevant.",
