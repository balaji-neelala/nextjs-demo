  "About_para1": "NITI Aayog is developing the National Data Analytics Platform, or NDAP, to increase access and usability of Indian government data. NDAP is envisioned to be a user-friendly web platform that provides easy access to government data in clean, machine-readable formats. The data on the platform is standardized across sectors, time, and geographies to enable interoperability and cross-sectoral analysis. NDAP will cater to the data needs of a broad set of users including government officials, academics, non-profits, and data journalists. NITI Aayog has released a limited-use beta-version of NDAP to support early users and gather user feedback.",
  "About_para2": "By foregrounding the experience of the data user and reducing the number of steps between accessing and using public datasets, NDAP seeks to increase the role of public data assets in research, decision-making and policy design. In the long term, the institutionalization of NDAP as a government-backed public good in the data ecosystem can help set standards for collecting and publishing clean and interface able unit-level data.",

NDAP is envisioned to be a user-friendly web platform that provides easy access to government data in clean, machine-readable formats. The data on the platform is standardized across sectors, time, and geographies to enable interoperability and cross-sectoral analysis. NDAP will cater to the data needs of a broad set of users including government officials, academics, non-profits, and data journalists. NITI Aayog has released a limited-use beta-version of NDAP to support early users and gather user feedback. By foregrounding the experience of the data user and reducing the number of steps between accessing and using public datasets, NDAP seeks to increase the role of public data assets in research, decision-making and policy design. In the long term, the institutionalization of NDAP as a government-backed public good in the data ecosystem can help set standards for collecting and publishing clean and interface able unit-level data.",

  "MergeQ1": "What does it mean to merge Datasets?",
  "MergeA1": "You can click on ‘Merge Datasets’ on the top of the Dataset detail page to combine the data tables from a maximum of three Datasets. The merge function will match key Dimensions from each Dataset and produce a single data table with common, standardised Geographic and Temporal Dimensions, along with Indicators from both Datasets. The final data table can be explored and visualised like any other Dataset.",
  "MergeQ2": "Can I merge Datasets from different locations (by applying the Granularity filter)?",
  "MergeA2": "Yes, you can merge two Datasets with different location-level granularities. However, the Dataset will be aggregated to the lowest-level of location-level granularity available in both the Datasets. For example, if a district-level Dataset is merged with a state-level Dataset, the district data will be aggregated to the state-level before being merged. The result will show all selected Indicators from both Datasets at the state-level.",
  "MergeQ3": "When merging Datasets, why do they get aggregated?",
  "MergeA3": "Datasets are aggregated when merging because the Dimensions need to be accurately matched. Since temporal and geographic Dimensions are the only types of Dimensions in the standardised {domain} schema, each Dataset must have only one observation per geographic and temporal row. Datasets must either be filtered or aggregated to achieve a single observation per geographic and temporal row. For example, if one district-level Dataset has ‘Gender’ as a Dimension, the values must either be aggregated across ‘Male’ and ‘Female’, or filtered to choose one between ‘Male’ and ‘Female’. Once aggregated or filtered, the district-level Dataset will contain a single observation per district which can then be matched to the second Dataset to merge. ",
  "MergeQ4": "Can I control what aggregations functions are used during the merge process?  ",

  "MergeQ12": "How are Temporal Columns or Time Columns handled when merging Datasets? ",
  "MergeA12": "{domain} merges Datasets based on standardised Geographic Identifiers while you select or collapse the data along the Temporal Identifiers. As a result, Datasets will have one row/observation per geographic unit, making the resultant merged Dataset also one row/observation per geographic unit.
